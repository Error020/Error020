I am ErrorImCodingkeller!
ðŸ’€ðŸ’»

I am doing programming tasks for individuals.
I have experience in C++, more specific technologies: multithreading+boost, some fundamental API's (WinAPI, Linux Kernel API's), even wxWidgets,
algorithmic "understanding" e.g. 
Documentations of programming languages and libraries helped me through some smaller projects in other languages 
so I am "kind of" experienced in : Python, C#, C, Javascript, LUA. 
I would say that my understanding of technology at hardware level is pretty deep....

Anyway, I hope my GitHub profile is "interesting" despite the lack of repositories on this account.
