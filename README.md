I'm ErrorImCodingkeller, it's basically "Error in the coding-basement" in German!

<!--
**Error020/Error020** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm currently "debugging" my life while doing small programming jobs for private people.
I am experienced in C++, more specific technologies : multithreading+boost, A few fundemental API's(WinAPI, linux kernel API's),
algorithmic "understanding" e. G. 
Documentations of Programming Languages and Libraries helped me through a few smaller projects in other languages 
so I'm "kinda" exerienced in : Python, C#, C, Javascript, LUA. 
I'd say that my understanding of Technology on a hardware level is quite deep...

Anyways, I hope that my GitHub is "interesting" even with the lack of repositories on this Account.
